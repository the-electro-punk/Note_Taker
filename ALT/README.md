# Note_Taker

# Description

This is a basic notetaker program. Users can create notes to keep track of data, schedules, names, etc. It uses HTML to format the main webpage, a Document-Object-Model based javascript file to record and upload notes. THe base format and code was given for the assignment and I had issues making it work properly. I have since learned how to better create such code and would love to go back and spruce it up.

# How to run the project

Just open up the webpage from the index file. Once inside, press get started to be taken to the notetaker page. There are separate input fields for the note's title and content. Once filled, simply press the submit button in the upper right (Note: due to issue, the code doesn't work properly and thus doesn't submit the notes)

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts
